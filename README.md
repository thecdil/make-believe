## Vis-arly

<br>
[Vis-arly](https://github.com/Scholarly-Projects/vis-arly) is a static web essay template currently in active development, designed to support visually-driven scholarly publications in the humanities. The template is an iteration of [CB-Essay](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-essay/) developed by Devin Becker, one of the many versions of [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) created by the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) at University of Idaho’s library.

The project was initially developed to host the author’s Master’s thesis, which examines the history of Dutch financial monopoly in Spokane, Washington and the city’s expressions of exclusionary and aspirational iconography through pageantry, commercial iconography and architecture. To support this visual resource-oriented study that closely analyzes archival images, I wanted to develop a digital framework that allowed the reader to engage seamlessly with the text, features and citations, while still meeting the academic rigour of a traditional thesis.

Vis-arly follows CollectionBuilder's static hosting approach, generating a lightweight reading interface from CSV-driven metadata and Markdown-formatted essay content with no server side processing. The template's design principle is a minimal, horizontal focus, where essay images and text citations remain “sticky” as they scroll vertically through the text, creating the feeling that no material is buried beneath the interface but you are only seeing the relevant materials you need as you navigate through the project. 

The scrolly-handler Javascript allows authors to place their images and citations strategically in their markdown files, which are triggered as the reader scrolls through the text. Additionally, the liquid commands which trigger images to start and stop within a passage allow the author to set XY coordinates and zoom levels, which adds a dynamic but completely programmatic control over the reading experience. 

An interstitial visualization function was developed which iterates off of the scrollytelling handler concept. The functionality allows users to insert data visualizations between chapter materials that progress as the reader scrolls down, allowing the author to provide additional context without diverting the reader to another area of the site. These “inter-vis” elements automatically adjust to reader display preferences, and a shared alt-text field for each visualization layer offers a creative approach to addressing many of the accessibility challenges associated with data visualizations.

Additional features were developed to reduce friction in the reading experience and foreground the archival material. An “infinite scroll” function allows readers to move seamlessly between essay chapters without navigating drop-down menus. Scroll state preservation ensures that readers who follow a citation or image link out to a collection item are returned to their exact position in the text on return. The site also supports light and dark mode, full mobile adaptability, and a dual keyboard navigation track that allows readers to cycle between site-level pages or drop to item-level pages independently.

Together, these features position Vis-arly as a reusable and adaptable framework for scholars working at the intersection of archival research, digital publication, and public-facing scholarship.
